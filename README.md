### Hi there 👋

I'm Nico. I'm a software engineer based in Texas. I mostly work with `TypeScript`, `React`, `Node.js`, and `GraphQL`. I have over 3 years of experience working on-site at large corporations & remotely at start-ups in full-stack developer roles. 

I created products like [partnerwise.io](https://partnerwise.io), [deaths.today](https://deaths.today), and more. You can learn more about me by visiting [my personal website](https://nico.ventures).

If you'd like to work with me, [shoot me an email](mailto:estrada@hey.com).
