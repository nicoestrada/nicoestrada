### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nico. I'm a software engineer based in Texas, and I am currently bootstrapping partnerwise.io and other projects. Nowadays I mostly work with `TypeScript`, `React`, `Node.js`, and `GraphQL`. I have over 3 years of experience working on-site at large corporations & remotely at start-ups in developer roles that enticed of greenfield projects, CI/CD, modernizing legacy code, and more.
